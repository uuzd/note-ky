P3 Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes 
anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is 
about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sports 
and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking 
part was intimidating for newcomers.
23. Parkrun is different from Olympic games in that it_____.
[A]aims at discovering talents
[B]focuses on mass competition
[C]does not emphasize elitism
[D]does not attract first-timers

P2 In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion annual 
budget fighting fires—nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago. In effect, 
fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency’s other work—such as forest conservation, 
watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep—that affect the lives of 
all Americans.

P1 A century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic included settlers and sojourners. Along 
with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had 
no intention to stay, and who would make some money and then go home. Between 1908 and 1915, 
about 7 million people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all Italian 
immigrants, for example, eventually returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate 
nickname, "uccelli di passaggio," birds of passage.
26. “Birds of passage” refers to those who____.
[A]immigrate across the Atlantic
[B]leave their home countries for good
[C]stay in a foreign country temporarily

P3 In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. 
But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’t 
when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap 
foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, 
everyone needs to find their extra — their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in

22. According to Paragraph 3, to be a successful employee, one has to____.
[A]work on cheap software
[B]ask for a moderate salary
[C]adopt an average lifestyle

P3 But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences 
of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside 
the U.S., lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more 
mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and 
freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict between races and classes.
38. Benjamin Friedman believes that economic recessions may____.
[A]impose a heavier burden on immigrants
[B]bring out more evils of human nature

P3 But as companies continue their attempts at personalized medicine, the courts will remain rather 
busy. The Myriad case itself is probably not over. Critics make three main arguments against gene 
patents: a gene is a product of nature, so it may not be patented; gene patents suppress innovation 
rather than reward it; and patents' monopolies restrict access to genetic tests such as Myriad's. A 
growing number seem to agree. Last year a federal task-force urged reform for patents related to 
genetic tests. In October the Department of Justice filed a brief in the Myriad case, arguing that an 
isolated DNA molecule “is no less a product of nature...than are cotton fibers that have been 
separated from cotton seeds.”
32. Those who are against gene patents believe that ____.
[A]genetic tests are not reliable
[B]only man-made products are patentable
[C]patents on genes depend much on innovation
[D]courts should restrict access to genetic tests

P4 Trade publications counselled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should 
create a “third stepping stone” between infant wear and older kids’ clothes. It was only after “toddler” 
became a common shoppers’ term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. 
Splitting kids, or adults, into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And 
one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences – or invent them where 
they did not previously exist.
29. We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised to____.
[A]focus on infant wear and older kids' clothes
[B]attach equal importance to different genders
[C]classify consumers into smaller groups
[D]create some common shoppers' terms

P2 This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes 
might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly, 
no homework should be assigned that students cannot complete on their own or that they cannot do 
without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not 
do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication 
that standards need to be lowered for poor children.
22. L. A. Unified has made the rule about homework mainly because poor students____.
[A]tend to have moderate expectations for their education
[B]have asked for a different educational standard
[C]may have problems finishing their homework
[D]have voiced their complaints about homework

P1 Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January, 2000; a year 
later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed

bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The

21. According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized for____.
[A]gaining excessive profits
[B]failing to fulfill her duty
[C]refusing to make compromises

### 英语
P2 But as recently as in 1968, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In 
some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, 
education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited 
intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West 
Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way 
around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
37. The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed ______.
[A]the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws
[B]the prevalent discrimination against certain races
[C]the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures
[D]the arrogance common among the Supreme Court judges

[A] the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws（反歧视法律的不足）——正确。文本明确说明“精英陪审员”的做法是“一种绕过反歧视法律的便捷方式”（provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws），这直接指出了法律的不完善。
[B] the prevalent discrimination against certain races（对某些种族的普遍歧视）——虽然精英陪审员做法可能导致种族歧视（因为某些种族可能被排除在外），但文本重点强调的是“绕过法律”的方式，而非直接讨论种族歧视的普遍性。
[C] the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures（陪审团选择程序中的理想冲突）——文本开头提到陪审团程序与民主理想冲突，但问题问的是“选择精英陪审员的做法”显示了什么，而这一做法具体显示的是法律漏洞，而非理想冲突本身。
[D] the arrogance common among the Supreme Court judges（最高法院法官的普遍傲慢）——文本提到最高法院禁止歧视，但未批评法官傲慢，反而说明他们的裁决被规避了。

[A]both literate and illiterate people can serve on juries
[B]defendants are immune from trial by their peers
[C]no age limit should be imposed for jury service
P1 Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, 
including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are 
equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative 
cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on 
account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; 
and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. 
The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. 
In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives 
to govern for them.

 36. From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that ____.

P5 Many first-generation students “struggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education, 
learn the ‘rules of the game,’ and take advantage of college resources,” they write. And this becomes 
more of a problem when colleges don’t talk about the class advantages and disadvantages of 
different groups of students. Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social 
class can affect students’ educational experience, many first-generation students lack insight about 
why they are struggling and do not understand how students like them can improve.
30. We may infer from the last paragraph that _____.
[A]universities often reject the culture of the middle-class 
[B]students are usually to blame for their lack of resources 
[C]social class greatly helps enrich educational experiences 
[D]colleges are partly responsible for the problem in question

with financial need, while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the students with at least one parent 
with a four-year degree.

 Knowing the results of Epley’s study, it makes sense that why people hate photographs of 
themselves viscerally—on one level, they don’t even recognise the person in the picture as 
themselves. Facebook, therefore, is a self-enhancer’s paradise, where people can share only the most 
flattering photos, the cream of their wit, style, beauty, intellect and lifestyle. “It’s not that people’s

P2 Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide newcomers into two categories: 
legal or illegal, good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or brand them as aliens to 
be kicked out. That framework has contributed mightily to our broken immigration system and the 
long political paralysis over how to fix it. We don't need more categories, but we need to change the 
way we think about categories. We need to look beyond strict definitions of legal and illegal. To 
start, we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We 
might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.
27. It is implied in paragraph 2 that the current immigration system in the US____.
[A]needs new immigrant categories
[B]has loosened control over immigrants 
[C]should be adapted to meet challenges
[D]has been fixed via political means

P1 Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in recent 
years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles 
Unified, are revising their thinking on this educational ritual. Unfortunately, L. A.Unified has 
produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced courses, 
homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student’s academic grade.
21. It is implied in paragraph 1 that nowadays homework____.
[A]is receiving more criticism
[B]is no longer an educational ritual
[C]is not required for advanced courses
[D]is gaining more preferences

```deepseek
根据第一段的内容，可以得出以下关键信息：

家庭作业一直不太受欢迎（Homework has never been terribly popular），但近年来尤其受到批评（in recent years it has been particularly scorned）。

许多学区正在重新审视家庭作业的作用（School districts...are revising their thinking on this educational ritual），例如洛杉矶联合学区（L.A. Unified）出台了一项硬性政策，限制家庭作业在成绩中的占比（不超过10%）。

选项分析：
[A] is receiving more criticism

正确。文中明确提到家庭作业“近年来尤其受到批评”（particularly scorned），且学区开始调整政策，说明批评的声音在增加。

[B] is no longer an educational ritual

错误。文中提到学区在“重新审视这一教育惯例”（revising their thinking on this educational ritual），但并未说家庭作业不再是教育惯例。

[C] is not required for advanced courses

错误。政策规定“除某些高级课程外”（with the exception of some advanced courses），说明高级课程仍然可能有家庭作业要求。

[D] is gaining more preferences

错误。文中明确提到家庭作业受到批评，政策也在限制其影响，与“更受青睐”矛盾。

结论：
正确答案是 [A] is receiving more criticism，因为第一段明确提到家庭作业近年来越来越受质疑，且学区政策调整也反映了这一趋势。

P5 A “southern” camp headed by France wants something different: “European economic 
government” within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians 
intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via 
cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. 
Finally, figures close to the French government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree 
to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour 
costs.
39. The French proposal of handling the crisis implies that ____. 
[A]poor countries are more likely to get funds 
[B]strict monetary policy will be applied to poor countries 
[C]loans will be readily available to rich countries
[D]rich countries will basically control Eurobonds

```deepseek
根据法国提出的应对危机方案，可以得出以下关键信息：

核心主张：建立“欧洲经济政府”（European economic government），在欧元区核心成员国之间进行经济治理。

具体措施：

政治干预货币政策（politicians intervening in monetary policy）。

建立从富国到穷国的财富再分配体系（a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members）。

通过共同欧元债券（Eurobonds）或财政转移支付（cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers），让政府获得更低成本的借款。

财政和社会协调（fiscal and social harmonization），例如限制企业税率或劳动力成本的竞争。

选项分析：
[A] poor countries are more likely to get funds

正确。法国的提议明确提到“从富国到穷国的财富再分配”（redistribution from richer to poorer members），这意味着穷国更可能获得资金支持。

[B] strict monetary policy will be applied to poor countries

错误。文中提到的是“政治家干预货币政策”，但并未具体说明会对穷国实施更严格的货币政策。

[C] loans will be readily available to rich countries

错误。法国的提议重点是让穷国更容易获得低成本借款（cheaper borrowing for governments），而不是富国。

[D] rich countries will basically control Eurobonds

错误。文中未提到富国将控制欧元债券，而是强调共同发行（common Eurobonds）以帮助穷国融资。

结论：
正确答案是 [A] poor countries are more likely to get funds，因为法国的方案明确提出了从富国到穷国的财富再分配机制。

P5 The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has 
been concentrated in areas where newspapers are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. 
So have science and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. 
Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper 
business.
29. What can be inferred from the last paragraph about the current newspaper business? 
[A]Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers. 
[B]Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper. 
[C]Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business. 
[D]Readers have lost their interest in car and film reviews.


```deepseek

根据第五段的内容，可以推断出当前报业的以下信息：

裁员主要集中在报纸最缺乏特色的领域（much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspapers are least distinctive），如汽车、电影评论、科学和商业报道，以及国外分社。

报纸因此变得不那么全面（Newspapers are less complete as a result），但全面性不再是报业的优势（But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business）。

选项分析：
[A] Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers.

正确。因为裁员集中在“最缺乏特色的领域”（least distinctive），暗示“特色（distinctiveness）”才是报业的关键，否则这些领域不会被优先裁减。

[B] Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper.

错误。文中提到“全面性不再是优势”，但并未说它是导致报业失败的原因。

[C] Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business.

错误。国外分社被大幅削减（savagely cut off），说明它们现在并非关键。

[D] Readers have lost their interest in car and film reviews.

错误。文中提到这些岗位被裁，但并未明确说是读者兴趣下降导致的，可能是成本或特色不足的原因。

结论：
正确答案是 [A] Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers.

P4 But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their 
reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were 
on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. 
Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. 
Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on 
campus.
24. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside directors____.
[A]may stay for the attractive offers from the firm
[B]have often had records of wrongdoings in the firm
[C]are accustomed to stress-free work in the firm
[D]will decline incentives from the firm

```Deepseek

根据最后一段的内容，可以推断出外部董事的以下信息：

研究人员认为，外部董事如果在坏消息爆发前离开公司，可以更容易避免声誉受损，即使历史记录显示他们在公司出现问题的时候仍在董事会中。

那些希望在困难时期留住外部董事的公司可能需要提供激励措施。

否则，外部董事可能会效仿Simmons女士的例子（即离开公司）。

根据这些信息，可以推断出外部董事可能会因为公司提供的吸引人的激励措施而留下来。因此，最符合的选项是：

[A] may stay for the attractive offers from the firm

其他选项的分析：

[B] have often had records of wrongdoings in the firm：文中提到的是“他们在公司出现问题的时候可能在董事会中”，并不是说他们自己有不当行为的记录。

[C] are accustomed to stress-free work in the firm：文中没有提到外部董事习惯于无压力的工作。

[D] will decline incentives from the firm：与文中意思相反，文中暗示激励措施可能会让他们留下来。

因此，正确答案是[A]。

P1 In an essay entitled “Making It in America,”, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from
cotton country about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill has
only two employees today, “a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there
to keep the man away from the machines.”
21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate____.
[A]the impact of technological advances
[B]the alleviation of job pressure
[C]the shrinkage of textile mills
[D]the decline of middle-class incomes

解题步骤：
1. 定位原文关键句
笑话内容：
```
The average mill has only two employees today, “a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.”
（现代纺织厂平均只有两名“员工”：一个人和一条狗。人的工作是喂狗，狗的工作是防止人靠近机器。）

```
笑话的上下文：
```
文章开篇提到这是一篇关于美国制造业现状的随笔（Making It in America）。
笑话前明确说明其目的是展示现代纺织厂的自动化程度（how much a modern textile mill has been automated）。
```
2. 理解笑话的讽刺点

核心讽刺：
工厂几乎完全自动化，人类的工作被简化为“喂狗”，而狗的作用是确保人类不干扰机器运作。
暗示技术进步导致人力需求锐减，甚至人类在生产流程中变得多余。

3. 排除法分析选项

```
[B] “工作压力的缓解”

错误：笑话未提及工作压力，而是强调人类岗位的消失。

[C] “纺织厂规模的缩减”

错误：笑话讨论的是员工数量减少（自动化），而非工厂物理规模缩小。

[D] “中产阶级收入的下降”

错误：笑话完全未涉及收入问题，属于无关选项。

[A] “技术进步的影响”

正确：直接对应原文“自动化”（automated），且笑话通过夸张手法体现技术对劳动力的替代。

P4 If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day—chewing gums, 
skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, 
colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins—are results of manufactured habits. A century 
ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of shrewd 
advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a 
cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.
P5 A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies 
started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled 
water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in 
commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are 
advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.
32. Bottled water, chewing gum and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph 5 so as to____.
[A]reveal their impact on people’s habits
[B]show the urgent need of daily necessities
[C]indicate their effect on people’s buying power
[D]manifest the significant role of good habits  

```

通过瓶装水、口香糖和润肤霜的例子，说明了这些产品如何通过广告和营销策略改变了人们的日常习惯。例如，瓶装水从非餐时不喝水的习惯转变为全天饮用，口香糖从青少年购买转变为餐后清新口气的产品，润肤霜被纳入早晨美容仪式。这些例子都是为了展示这些产品对人们习惯的影响。

因此，正确答案是：

[A] reveal their impact on people’s habits

其他选项：
[B] show the urgent need of daily necessities（未提及“急需”）
[C] indicate their effect on people’s buying power（未提及购买力）
[D] manifest the significant role of good habits（重点不是好习惯的作用，而是产品如何制造习惯）

P3 Infants are wired to look at parents’ faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are 
blank and unresponsive—as they often are when absorbed in a device—it can be extremely 
disconcerting for the children. Radesky cites the "still face experiment" devised by developmental 
psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal 
way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback. The child 
becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother’s attention." Parents don’t have 
to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be 
responsive and sensitive to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need," says 
Radesky.
28. Radesky’s cites the “still face experiment” to show that_____.
[A]it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions
[B]verbal expressions are unnecessary for emotional exchange
[C]children are insensitive to changes in their parents’ mood
[D]parents need to respond to children’s emotional needs


```

文本关键信息：
实验内容：母亲先正常与孩子互动，然后突然保持空白表情（blank expression），不提供任何视觉社交反馈（no visual social feedback）。

结果：孩子变得非常痛苦（distressed），试图重新获得母亲的注意。

Radesky的结论：

“Parents don’t have to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance...”

“Parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need.”

选项分析：
[A] 孩子容易习惯空白表情

原文明确说孩子会“distressed”（痛苦），与“get used to”（习惯）矛盾。排除。

[B] 语言表达对情感交流不必要

原文未提到“verbal expressions are unnecessary”，且实验强调“nonverbal feedback”（如面部表情）的重要性。排除。

[C] 孩子对父母情绪变化不敏感

原文明确说孩子对父母的blank expression非常敏感（表现为distressed），与选项矛盾。排除。

[D] 父母需要回应孩子的情感需求

完全匹配Radesky的结论：“parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child’s... emotional need”。实验也证明，缺乏回应会导致孩子痛苦，说明回应的重要性。

干扰项排除：
[A][C]与实验现象直接矛盾。

[B]是无关信息（原文未讨论“verbal expressions是否必要”）。

正确答案：
[D] parents need to respond to children’s emotional needs

补充解析：
实验的目的是证明孩子依赖父母的情感反馈（尤其是非语言的，如面部表情），若父母无反应，孩子会感到痛苦。因此，Radesky引用实验是为了支持她的观点：父母需对孩子的情绪需求保持回应（responsive and sensitive）。


 译文:  
 婴儿天生就会通过观察父母的面孔来理解他们所处的世界，而如果父母的脸上毫无表情、毫无回应 —— 就像他们沉浸在电子设备中时常常表现的那样 —— 这会让孩子感到极度不安。

拉德斯基引用了发展心理学家埃德・特罗尼克在 20 世纪 70 年代设计的 “静止面孔实验”。在这个实验中，母亲先被要求以正常方式与孩子互动，随后再摆出毫无表情的面孔，不再给予孩子任何视觉上的社交反馈。孩子在试图吸引母亲注意力的过程中，会变得越来越痛苦。

拉德斯基表示：“父母不必时刻都做到完美无缺，但需要把握一种平衡，而且父母要对孩子通过语言或非语言方式表达的情感需求做出回应，并保持敏感。”

P3 This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most 
“happiness bang for your buck.” It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their 
commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television 
(something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier 
for it). Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, 
and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason 
MacDonald’s restricts the availability of its popular McRib——a marketing trick that has turned 
the pork sandwich into an object of obsession.
23. MacRib is mentioned in Paragraph 3 to show that ____.
[A]consumers are sometimes irrational
[B]popularity usually comes after quality
[C]marketing tricks are often effective
[D]rarity generally increases pleasure

```
正确答案是 [D] rarity generally increases pleasure（稀缺性通常会增加愉悦感）。

解析：
段落主旨：

本段核心观点是 “适度消费能提升幸福感”（luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly）。

作者举例说明：购买礼物或捐款比为自己购物更快乐，而奢侈品在偶尔享受时（sparingly）带来的愉悦感最强。

McRib的例子：

麦当劳限量供应McRib（restricts the availability），利用营销策略（marketing trick）使其成为消费者疯狂追捧的对象（object of obsession）。

这一例子直接支持前文观点：稀缺性（rarity） 能增强消费者的愉悦感（对应前文“luxuries are most enjoyable when consumed sparingly”）。

排除其他选项：

[A] consumers are sometimes irrational：消费者对McRib的狂热可能看似非理性，但段落重点并非讨论理性问题。

[B] popularity comes after quality：未提及McRib的质量，仅强调其限量供应的营销策略。

[C] marketing tricks are often effective：虽然提到营销策略，但目的是说明稀缺性（而非策略本身）如何提升快乐感。

结论：
McRib的例子是为了证明 “稀缺性增加愉悦感” 这一观点，故选 [D]。

fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three 
manufacturing jobs — about 6 million in total — disappeared.”
23. The quotation in Paragraph 4 explains that____.
[A]gains of technology have been erased
[B]job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed
[C]factories are making much less money than before
[D]new jobs and services have been offered


```
解析：
引用的核心内容：

Davidson 指出，2009年之前的10年间，美国工厂裁员速度极快，几乎抵消了过去70年的就业增长（"erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years"）。

具体数据：约三分之一的制造业岗位（总计600万）消失（"roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs — about 6 million in total — disappeared"）。

引用的目的：

说明新技术导致 工作岗位加速流失（与段首“acceleration”呼应），而非技术本身的收益被抹去（[A]错误）。

强调 就业机会的快速减少（[B]正确），而非工厂利润下降（[C]未提及）或新岗位的出现（[D]与原文矛盾）。

排除其他选项：

[A] gains of technology have been erased：被抹去的是“就业增长”（job gains），而非技术收益。

[C] factories are making much less money：原文未提及工厂利润，只讨论就业岗位减少。

[D] new jobs and services have been offered：与引用的裁员数据完全相反。

结论：
引用数据是为了证明 工作机会正在高速消失，故选 [B]。

作者反问：为何社会认为学生应该能背出“美国第13任总统的名字”（机械记忆），却对“修理断裂的自行车链条”（实际技能）束手无策？

自行车链条的例子：

断裂的自行车链条代表一个需要动手解决的日常问题，而学生对此“完全不知所措”（utterly overwhelmed），说明他们缺乏 实践能力（practical ability）。

这一例子直接对比了“死记硬背的知识”和“实际生活技能”的缺失，呼应前文“学习应是实践性的”这一观点。

排除其他选项：

[A] mechanical memorization（机械记忆）：与例子矛盾，学生能记住总统名字，说明机械记忆能力并不缺。

[B] academic training（学术训练）：自行车链条问题与学术知识无关。

[D] pioneering spirit（开拓精神）：段落虽提到“pioneering”，但例子与创新精神无关，而是强调实践能力。

P2 This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in 
public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage. 
P3 The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s. Sociologist 
Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book Divorce Talk that most of the women she 
interviewed—but only a few of the men—gave lack of communication as the reason for their 
divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent，that amounts to millions of cases in 
the United States every year —a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.
27. Judging from the context, the phrase “wreaking havoc”（Line2, Para.2）most probably means 
____.
[A]generating motivation
[B]exerting influence
[C]causing damage
[D]creating pressure

```
解析：

第二段指出，美国男性在公共场合比女性说话更多，但在家里却说话更少，这种模式正在"wreaking havoc with marriage"（对婚姻造成破坏）。

第三段进一步说明，许多女性将缺乏沟通作为离婚的原因，且当前离婚率高达50%，这表明这种沟通模式对婚姻产生了严重的负面影响。

"wreaking havoc" 是一个固定短语，意为"造成严重破坏"或"带来灾难性影响"，与 [C] 选项 "causing damage" 意思最为接近。

其他选项：
[A] "generating motivation"（产生动力）与上下文矛盾；
[B] "exerting influence"（施加影响）程度不够准确；
[D] "creating pressure"（制造压力）虽有一定关联，但不如 [C] 贴切

P2 If “entitled” is the most common adjective, fairly or not, applied to millennials (those born 
between 1981 and 1995), the catchwords for Generation Z are practical and cautious. According to 
the career counselors and experts who study them, Generation Zs are clear-eyed, economic 
pragmatists. Despite graduating into the best economy in the past 50 years, Gen Zs know what an 
economic train wreck looks like. They were impressionable kids during the crash of 2008, when 
many of their parents lost their jobs or their life savings or both. They aren’t interested in taking any 
chances. The booming economy seems to have done little to assuage this underlying generational

P3 Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally 
better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students 
back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and 
environmental changes—all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year 
experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand 
new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation
blunders.
33. The word “acclimation”（Line 6, Para. 3）is closest in meaning to _____.
[A]adaptation
[B]application 
[C]motivation 
[D]competition

根据上下文分析，“acclimation”一词出现在讨论学生如何适应大学生活的环境中。文章提到，间隔年可以帮助学生更好地适应新的环境、独立和责任，从而减少在适应大学全新环境时的困难。因此，“acclimation”最可能指的是“适应”新环境的过程。

选项中：
[A] adaptation（适应）与上下文最契合。
[B] application（申请、应用）、[C] motivation（动机）、[D] competition（竞争）均与“适应新环境”的语义无关。

正确答案：[A] adaptation

P6 Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is 
not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers — in their 
pockets, in their offices, in their homes — for the rest of their lives. The younger they learn how 
computers think, how to coax the machine into producing what they want — the earlier they learn 
that they have the power to do that — the better.
25. The word “coax”（Para.6）is closest in meaning to _____.
[A]challenge
[B]persuade
[C]frighten
[D]misguide

```
选项中最贴近的是 [B] persuade（劝说、引导），其他选项均不符合：

[A] challenge（挑战）→ 无“引导”含义

[C] frighten（恐吓）→ 与机器互动无关

[D] misguide（误导）→ 负面含义，与文意相反

x^3 = x(3x - 1) = 3x^2 -x = 3(3x-1) -x = 9x -3 -x = 8x -3 

x^4 = x(8x-3) = 8x^2 -3x = 8*(3x-1)-3x = 24x-8-3x = 21x-8
x^5 = x(21x-8) = 21x^2 - 8x = 21*(3x-1) - 8x = 63x-21 -8x = 55x -21

55x-21 - 3*(21x-8) + 2*(8x-3) -3*(3x-1) +x +2

sweeping ruling (全面性裁决 ) particularly one that upsets (打翻，弄翻 ) the old assumption
(过去的假定) that authorities ( 当局=government) may search through (查找) the possessions of 
suspects (嫌疑人所有物) at the time of their arrest.
```

主干[基本句型: 主+谓+宾+宾补]:  ask sb to do sth 
```
California ( 加利福利亚) has asked the justice ( 法官) to refrain from (不做)
sweeping ruling (全面性裁决 )
```

(过去的假定)

修饰2: [that引导的同位语从句] that authorities ( 当局=government) may search through (查找) the possessions of 
suspects (嫌疑人所有物)


==》 区分 that引导的定语从句还是同位语从句 主要区分看主干是否完整, 完整的是同位语从句, 缺主语或宾语的是同位语从句

y-35

x-56 = 3/4 *(y-35)

4y/3 - 56 = 3y/4 -35*3/4

16y - 56*12 = 9y - 35*9

设工人x
x+(x-5x/12) + 735*1/5 = 735
所以x = 300

2. C

x+y+z = 270
设 装配了m 件
所以
x = 5m/3, y = 4m/3, z = 3m/2
5m/3 + 4m/3 + 3m/2 = 270

 利润1 

单件利润2 * 数量2 - 单件利润1*数量1

单件利润2  * 1.8 - 单件利润1
--------------------------  ????
单件利润1


单件利润2 = 0.9出-成本

 (出-成)/出 = 0.25

成本 = 0.75出
单件利润2 = 0.9出-0.75出 = 0.15出

0.15出 * 1.8 - 0.25出
